# Snakebytes Frontend

Snakebytes game frontend, this is a classic snake game that pays
sats to the leader of the leaderboard after some time has passed.

The prize is paid as a PGP encrypted cashu token, the user needs to sign in
with an username and a PGP public key to play.

There are some anti-cheat measures planned. But initially the prize will be so low that it will not be worth to cheat.

## Running the code
